/// A WaitWorker provides a way to perform a task with a higher granularity to the waiting operation.
///
/// A typical use case would be to wait on a background task to set a flag with a 60 second timeout. This would be accomplished by
/// the following example:
///
///     bool success = WaitWorker.execFor(60000, intervalMS: 10)
///     {
///         // Return `true` if our worker has finished its work, otherwise we return `false` to keep waiting
///         return backgroundWorker.isFinished()
///     }
///
///     if !success
///     {
///         print("The operation timed out waiting for isDone to become true")
///     }
///
/// In the example above, we are waiting for `backgroundWorker` to report it is finished, with a timeout of 60 seconds. The
/// `WaitWorker` will call the block every 10 milliseconds (the `intervalMS` parameter) until it returns `true` or until the total
/// time elapsed reaches 60 seconds.
public struct WaitWorker
{
	/// We sleep for periods of time this long until the total time is elapsed
	public static let kDefaultSleepIntervalMS: Int = 10

	/// Repeatedly executes `operation` until it completes or up to `timeoutMS` milliseconds, sleeping for `intervalMS`
	/// milliseconds between each execution
	///
	/// `operation` should return `true` if it has completed its task. Otherwise, `operation` will be called again after
	/// `intervalMS` millisecond sleep.
	///
	/// If `intervalMS` is not specified, it defaults to `WaitWorker.kSleepIntervalMS`. If `intervalMS` is <= 0, there will be no
	/// sleep between executions of `operation`.
	///
	/// If `timeoutMS` is <= 0, this method returns `false` immediately without calling `operation`.
	///
	/// The total time of execution could theoretically be as long as the total `timeoutMS` time plus the execution time of
	/// `operation`.
	///
	/// The precision of timing in this method is dependent upon the execution time of `operation` as well as `Thread.sleep`.
	///
	/// Returns `true` if the operation completed before `timeoutMS`, otherwise `false`
