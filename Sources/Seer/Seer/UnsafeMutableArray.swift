/// Efficient container for storing a contiguous group of stored values
///
/// ***
/// *** IMPORTANT ***
/// ***
///
///		Do not store class objects in any way in this container. To be clear on this point, use this for built-in stored value
///		types (Int, UInt32, etc.) and structures.
///
///		If you store a structure in this container, ensure that the structure does not contain an object, all the way down the
///		chain members. Not heeding this advice will likely get you a crash right away.
///
///		In addition, you are responsible for freeing the memory allocated by calling `free()`.
///
/// **
/// ** PURPOSE
/// **
///
/// Swift's ARC is a solid and robust memory management mechanism and very helpful. However, it can lead to performance loss in
/// areas where performance is absolutely critical. Swift's arrays, though performant can still lead to unexpected performance loss
/// with range checking, copy-on-write, etc.
///
/// The goal of the UnsafeMutableArray is to provide an array that can be passed around with no ARC overhead, while allowing very
/// fast, direct-from-memory access to stored values. However, it is up to the caller to free the resources used by this array
/// by calling `free()`.
///
/// Think of an UnsafeMutableArray as an extension to UnsafeMutablePointer which contains a `count` of used elements in the array
/// along with a `capacity` of total elements the array can store.
///
/// **
/// ** USAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
/// **
///
///	UnsafeMutableArray has a very simple interface, akin to what you would expect from an array in C. Like a standard C array, you
/// manage the storage requirements of a UnsafeMutableArray. The array's `capacity` must be specified up front. It can be re-sized,
/// but it's up to you to control how and when tha that happens (see `ensureReservation()`).
///
/// The two primary properties, `capacity` and `count` are managed separately. `capacity` represents the total available storage
/// (in terms of the number of elements of type `T` in the array.) `count` represents the number of elements stored in the array.
///
/// Generally speaking, you are responsible for the state of the memory in the array (it is not initialized or cleared.) The one
/// exception to this is `init(repeating:count:)`. As a result clearing the array (via `removeAll` is nearly instantaneous as all
/// it has to do is to set `count` to 0.
///
/// Adding elements to the array (via `add()`) is as simple as a storing a value into the array and incrementing the `count`
/// property. However, you can directly manipulate `count`. This can be useful for operations that convert the array from one
/// representation of data into another, smaller (i.e., fewer `count` elements) representation of data.
///
/// Overruns are managed via `assert` in debug mode, but that protection goes away in optimized builds.
