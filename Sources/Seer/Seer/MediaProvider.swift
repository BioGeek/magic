/// A Media Provider is an implementation that runs through individual frames of video input either from live video or captured
/// media files such as MP4 or MOV files as well as still images like PNG or JPG files. Frames are then processed through a
/// `MediaConsumer` object (provided at initialization.)
///
/// Implementing the `MediaProvider` protocol requires support for managing media (loading media, jumping to the next/previous
/// media file, basic playback functionality and status information.
///
/// In addition, since it is the `MediaProvider`'s responsibility to process that media through the `MediaConsumer`, the
/// implementation is also required for storing the current `CodeDefinition` used for processing media through the `MediaConsumer`.

	/// Pre-frame callback
	///
	/// Pre-frame callbacks are blocks that are called prior to processing a video frame through the `MediaConsumer`. This is a
	/// one-time call and must be set for each frame.
	///
	/// Only one callback can be associated at a given time. Therefore, setting two callbacks would result in the first callback
	/// being overridden by the first and only one callback (the second) being called.

	/// Post-frame callback
	///
	/// Post-frame callbacks are blocks that are called after processing a video frame through the `MediaConsumer`. This is a
	/// one-time call and must be set for each frame.
	///
	/// Only one callback can be associated at a given time. Therefore, setting two callbacks would result in the first callback
	/// being overridden by the first and only one callback (the second) being called.
