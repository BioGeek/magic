	/// Determine the probability of a scanned set of card indices is likely to be valid and return a confidence factor.
	///
	/// Validation is performed using a statistical analysis of incoming results against the recent history of results. This
	/// approach follows the premise that the scanning and decoding process is designed to return correct results and that those
	/// results will gravitate towards correctness.
	///
	/// It is surmised that any deviation from a correct result will be generally minor and caused by the lossy and imprecise
	/// nature of the input. It is further surmised that as errors introduced by by lossy and imprecise input will introduce
	/// probabilistically random errors.
	///
	/// Therefore, it follows that a sample of results over a period of time should contain a random distribution of errors with
	/// a single clear outlier for the correct answer.
	///
	/// It is important to note that not all errors are caused by lossy and imprecise input. Some examples of errors introduced
	/// by input that can generate consistent errors:
	///
	///    * Poorly printed marks on a marked deck
	///    * An environmental condition (a deck sitting on a shag carpet obscuring the bottom group of cards)
	///
	/// The confidence factor:
	///
	/// This factor represents the relative ratio between the number of times this particular deck has been scanned with the number
	/// of times that the largest of any other result was scanned.
	///
	/// If the card indices being validated were the most popular, then the confidence factor will be a positive value >= 1.0,
	/// which represents how much more popular this result was, compared to the second-most-popular result. If, for example, this
	/// result was scanned 10 times and the next-most-popular result was only scanned 3 times, then the confidence factor will
	/// be 3.333 (this result was 3.333 times more popular.)
	///
	/// If the card indices being validated were not the most popular, then the confidence factor will be a value in the range
	/// [0.0 < factor < 1.0].
	///
	/// If we do not have enough history, then the confidence factor returned will be 0.0
	///
	/// Finally, this method can return nil in cases of inconclusive decodes. This is done in order to allow inconclusive results
