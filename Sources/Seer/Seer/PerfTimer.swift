/// A global variable used by the PerfTimer class in order to ensure its lifetime
var globalVar = 0

/// A class used to track performance information related to the time spent performing various serial operations. This class should
/// not be instantiated as it contains class methods.
///
/// The PerfTimer records all time between calls to start() and stop(). During that time, a block of code can be individually
/// monitored by calling track() like so:
///
/// 		PerfTimer.track("Call to doSomething")
///			{ { () -> CVPixelBuffer? in
///				do_something()
///			}
///
/// In cases where the calculation of a value is being tracked, it may be necessary to return that value from within the scope of
/// the tracking closure. Here is a simple example:
///
/// 		return PerfTimer.track("Call to doSomething", operation:
///			{
///				let foo = calculate_something()
///				return foo
///			})
///
/// In some cases, the return type is too complex for the compiler to infer the return type. The solution is thus:
///
/// 		return PerfTimer.track("Call to doSomething", operation:
///			{ () -> SomeType? in
///				let foo = calculate_something()
///				return foo
///			})
///
/// Use reset() to nullify the state of the PerfTimer to an initial, non-started state.
///
/// Use logStats() to display the stats. Note that calling logStats() will stop the PerfTimer.

	///
	/// Declare this object at some point in a scoped block of code and when that scope ends, this object will deinit,
	/// automatically stopping the timer and recording the event time.
	///
	/// Be careful to take note of this object's use in blocks and other situations where object cleanup is altered from normal
	/// expectations. Ensure to call the `use()` method at some point after constructing this object. This prevents the Swift
	/// optimizer from destructing the object immediately after creation.
