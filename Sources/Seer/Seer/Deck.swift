	/// Resolve the raw set of ScannedRows (of ScannedCards) into a single set of card indices, returning that set of indices for a

	///
	/// The resolution process is the final and critical step in determining the existence and ordering of cards in a deck of cards
	/// found within an image.
	///
	/// Resolve sessions
	///
	///		A resolve session starts by calling the aptly named method, `startResolveSession`. This resets the internal memory used
	///		by the decoder and prepares it to start accepting cards.
	///
	///		The next step is to add the various cards found from raw scans. This is done by calling `addCard()` for each card found
	///		in the scanned image.
	///
	///		Finally, call this method to resolve the unordered super-set of cards into a single, cohesive deck (or an appropriate
	///		failure result.)
	///
	/// Implementation details
	///
	///     The cards in this deck are assumed to be grouped by consecutive counts (see `Decoder.decode()`)
	///
	///		Each ScannedRow can contain a number of ScannedCards, often of multiple face values. Some of those cards may be false
	///		positives and cases of multiple cards overlapping the same rows is commonplace. This poses a challenge to resolving the
	///		true order of the deck.
	///
	///		Fortunately, there is a lot of information available. Each rows notes the set of cards scanned from that row along with
	///		the frequency for that card.
	///
	///		Using this information, the deck is resolved through the use of a set of rules. Each rule is crafted to make decisions
	///		that with a configurable level of confidence. This confidence comes from using the available data to find consensus
	///		among the data itself.
	///
	///		The result will be stored in the Deck's `resolvedIndices` property.
	///
	/// Challenge confidence and ties
	///
	///		The challenges applied within rules is the key aspect of the resolution process. A confident challenge (say, a winning
	///		card is chosen only if it wins by a factor of 2) will be likely to produce a higher percentage of correct results while
	///		also providing more inconclusive results when a winner cannot be clearly chosen. Conversely, a less confident challenge
	///		will produce more winners, even if those winners are sometimes incorrect. More winners (correct or otherwise) means
	///		more results, at least some of which are likely to be correct, allowing for more reports back to the user.
	///
	///		Theoretically, it should be better to go with the less confident challenge as this would increase the total number of
	///		results for consideration. If there is not a tie, then the statistically likelihood of a correct result would be above
	///		50%. The down-side to this is that the overall accuracy percentage is likely to drop, placing a higher reliance on the
	///		statistical history to cull those results that are invalid.
	///
	///		By extension, a winner chosen at random from a tie would have a similar effect, with the probability of the result
	///		being 50%.
