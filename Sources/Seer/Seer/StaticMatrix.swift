/// Efficient container class for storing a constant-sized array of dynamically-sized arrays
///
/// ***
/// *** IMPORTANT ***
/// ***
///
///		Do not store class objects in any way in this container. To be clear on this point, use this for built-in stored value
///		types (Int, UInt32, etc.) and structures.
///
///		If you store a structure in this container, ensure that the structure does not contain an object, all the way down the
///		chain members.
///
///		Not heeding this advice will likely get you a crash right away.
///
/// **
/// ** PURPOSE
/// **
///
/// Swift's ARC is a solid and robust memory management mechanism and very helpful. However, it can lead to performance loss in
/// areas where performance is absolutely critical. Swift's arrays, though performant can still lead to unexpected performance loss
/// with range checking, copy-on-write, etc.
///
/// The goal of the StaticMatrix is to provide an object (StaticMatrix is a class) that can be passed around with minimal ARC
/// overhead, while allowing very fast, direct-from-memory access to a 2-dimensional set of stored values.
///
/// **
/// ** USAGE AND IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
/// **
///
///	StaticMatrix is a very simple class, akin to what you would expect from an 2D array in C. Like a standard C array, you manage
/// the storage requirements of a StaticMatrix. The matrix's two capacity values (`rowCapacity` and `colCapacity`) must be
/// specified up front. It can be re-sized, but it's up to you to control how and when tha that happens (see `ensureReservation()`).
///
/// The three primary properties, `rowCapacity`, `colCapacity` and `count` are managed separately. `rowCapacity` and `colCapacity`
/// represent the total available storage (in terms of the number of elements of type `T` in each dimension of the matrix.) `count`
/// represents the total number of elements stored in the matrix.
///
/// Generally speaking, you are responsible for the state of the memory in the matrix (it is not initialized or cleared.) As a
/// result clearing the array (via `removeAll` is very fast as all it has to do is to set `count` to 0 and initialize each of the
/// individual column counts to 0.
///
/// The matrix is automatically allocated and freed upon de-initialization.
///
/// Adding elements to the matrix (via `add()`) is as simple as a storing a value into the matrix, incrementing the `count`
/// property and incrementing the count for the row where the value is stored.
///
/// Overruns are managed via `assert` in debug mode, but that protection goes away in optimized builds.
///
/// This is based on UnsafeMutableArray, which is an unsafe, unmanaged 1-dimensional array.
///
/// **
/// ** ACCESSING ROWS AND COLUMNS
/// **
///
/// Note that the `rowCount` is constant; rows cannot be added. Therefore, the `rowCount` property will always return the row's
/// capacity.
///
/// Each row in the matrix works like an individual UnsafeMutableArray, with each row having a separate count. As elements are
/// added to a row (see `add(toRow:value:)`) the `count` for that row will grow. To access the count for any row, use
/// `colCount(row:)`.
