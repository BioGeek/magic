	/// Generates a series of search lines that follow a prioritized ordering scheme for optimal deck location searches
	///
	/// The image is scanned starting at the 'origin' (by default, the center of the image) using a coarse pattern of search lines
	/// that radiate out and away from the origin. This process continues until a deck is located or the entire image area has been
	/// covered. Whenever a deck is found, the origin is moved to that location in order to take advantage of the temporal nature of
	/// tracking objects in video input.
	///
	/// The deck is generally assumed to have a tendency toward a horizontal orientation, but as this will not always be the case,
	/// off-axis (rotated) scans are included in the pattern. The order of these scans is decided by a priority-based heuristic.
	///
	/// The purpose of the heuristic is to answer the question: "What's more likely, A deck that is farther away from the origin,
	/// or one that is rotated off-axis a bit?"
	///
	/// GENERATING SEARCH LINES:
	///
	/// Each search line has an anchor point (which specifies its vertical offset from the origin) and an angle of rotation. As
	/// lines are moved or rotated, they do so in steps. Step amounts are chosen such that they allow coverage without requiring the
	/// scanning of every image sample. This is done carefully as step sizes are a trade-off of accuracy and speed.
	///
	/// A set of search lines is generated with anchor points that step vertically away from the origin in the positive and negative
	/// directions. it is important that enough search lines are generated to cover twice area of the image. This is the case
	/// because the origin may not be in the center of the image. For example, if the origin was moved to the negative extent, there
	/// would need to be enough positive search lines to cover the full height of the image.
	///
	/// Similar sets of search lines are also generated with for each step of rotation in the positive and negative directions.
	///
	/// In addition to this pattern, the step values increase with greater distance or angle. This allows for higher density
	/// scanning near the origin where the deck is most likely to be (see the note about temporal tracking above) without suffering
	/// that density for the entire image.
	///
	/// THE HEURISTIC:
	///
	/// Each search line is assigned a weight based on its distance from the origin and angle of rotation. Search lines that are
	/// farther from the origin and/or have a higher angle of rotation will receive larger weights.
	///
	/// Weights are balanced such that rotation receives a slightly higher weight than distance in order to provide a priority to
	/// horizontal scanning.
	///
	/// THE GOAL:
	///
	/// The final outcome should resemble the following. Note that the list below is a set of offset steps (offStep) distance from
	/// the origin and rotational steps (rotStep) rotations from horizontal. In this example, there are only two rotational steps.
	///
	///     0.  Start at the origin, the horizontal search line is scanned (offStep 0, rotStep 0)
	///     1.  (offStep 1, rotStep 0)
	///     2.  (offStep 2, rotStep 0)
	///     3.  (offStep 0, rotStep 1)
	///     4.  (offStep 3, rotStep 0)
	///     5.  (offStep 4, rotStep 0)
	///     6.  (offStep 0, rotStep 2)
	///     7.  (offStep 5, rotStep 0)
	///     8.  (offStep 6, rotStep 0)
	///     9.  (offStep 1, rotStep 1)
	///     10. (offStep 6, rotStep 0)
	///     11. (offStep 7, rotStep 0)
	///     12. (offStep 1, rotStep 2)
	///     13. (offStep 8, rotStep 0)
	///     14. (offStep 9, rotStep 0)
	///     15. (offStep 2, rotStep 1)
	///     ...
	///
	/// Note that the #1 and #2 take place with no rotation, simply stepping vertically away from the origin. However, at #3, the
	/// weight of rotation finally overcomes the weight of distance and a single step of rotation is made (back at the origin:
	/// offStep 0). Scanning then proceeds to step further from the origin until once again the distance is too great and the weight
	/// of the second rotational step at the origin finally overcomes the weight of distance. You can see this pattern continue,
	/// eventually allowing rotation in offset steps 1 and 2.
	///
	/// Although this pattern seems simple, using a heuristic allows us the flexibility to do quite a lot to control the importance
	/// of offset versus rotation. We could, for example, make the weights non-linear by squaring them. We could scale them relative
	/// to each other such that the farther distances from the origin balance the weight scale and allow for more rotation (or the
	/// opposite.) There are plenty of options here.
