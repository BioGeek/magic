	/// Decodes a deck (ordered list of cards) from a given set of MarkLines and returns the DecodeResult.
	///
	/// Priority is given to accuracy, with all other considerations focused on being as efficient as possible. Given that, extra
	/// steps are taken during the decode process, such as analyzing the samples of the MarkLines to determine if their sharpness
	/// and if they are fit (or unfit) for decoding.
	///
	/// Efficiency of the decode process is attained by boiling it down to simple bit masking. This is made possible by the use of
	/// BitPatterns, which define the bits that match a maximal and unique set of bit combinations that span a set of rows,
	/// covering the jog range (see BitPattern for further details.) In addition, the MarkLines are also converted to a set of
	/// combined words covering the full jog range (see MarkLines.generateWordRows for details.)
	///
	/// Given a set of words that represent the masks and a set of words that represent rows of MarkLines, we simply need to
	/// perform the masking and combine the masks to form the final Card Code. This is a bit of tricky bit masking because
	/// (assuming a jog range of [-2,+2]) each word in the BitPattern and MarkLines represents five 12-bit values concatenated into
	/// a single 60-bit word. These 12 values must be shifted and merged into a single 12-bit value.
	///
	/// The results of this are stored in a Deck in the form of a series of ScannedRows of ScannedCards.
	///
	/// Ths Deck is then resolved in order to provide a final DecodeResult.
	///
	/// Possible DecodeResults are:
	///
	///		* NotSharp       - The image samples that form the MarkLines were determined to be too blurry
	///		* GeneralFailure - The MarkLines failed to convert to rows of words
	///		* TooFewCards    - The resolved deck fell below the minimum threshold (see Deck.kMinCards)
	///		* Decoded        - The deck was decoded with confidence
	///
	/// It should be noted that even a confident decode can be wrong. There is no way to guarantee a perfectly accurate decode,
	/// even manually by a human with high intelligence. Cards may be hidden or unreadable in the image. But most of these issues
	/// should be resolved via the use of a histogram of recent results to eliminate likely incorrect scans/decodes. For more
	/// information on this, see ScanManager.validateDecodedCards().
