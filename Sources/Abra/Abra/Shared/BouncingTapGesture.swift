/// A modified version of `.onTapGesture` that applies a quick scaling "bouncing" spring animation, applied to the scale of the view.
///
/// Use it like so:
///
/// 	@State var scale: CGFloat = 1
/// 	SomeView()
///			.modifier(bouncingTapGesture(scale: $scale, bounceScale: 1.3) {
///				// your code here to manage the tap gesture
///			})
///
///	Note that the provided block is executed at the peak of the bounce animation. If, for example the block alters an icon image,
///	that transition will happen at the peak of the initial bounce before returning to the original size.
