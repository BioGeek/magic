/// Our application-specific `ServerPeer` implementation, handling payloads specific to Steve
///
/// This class is responsible for handling all server-related operations, such as handling connections and disconnections,
/// responding to pings and payloads and so on.
///
/// This base implementation should serve as a starting point, but a minimum set of actions are required by the subclass
/// implementation. For example, it is likely that the subclass implementation will need to create a custom factory method
/// (ex: `createMyServerPeer`, similar to `createServerPeer`) which is used when instantiating a `MediaConsumer`.
///
/// In addition, it is expected that the subclass implementation will override `onServerConnect` and provide a minimum custom
/// implementation that sends a `ServerConnectMessage`.
///
/// All subclass implementations should be sure to call the `super` implementation unless they have a good reason not to.
