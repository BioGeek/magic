Steve

	- If steve starts without a video file, it will not start properly when one is dragged into the UI

Seer

	- Cleanup the whole playLastFrame, replayLastFrame and replayTemporalState mess
	- Move image rotation from the rPI to the app
		- Note that the rpi would still need to know when the camera is upside down
		  and rotate the search lines accordingly (and perhaps other stuff?)

Whisper

	- Software updates need to be hardened against bricking the device
	- Add support for WiFi configuration

Abra

	- iOS bugs:
		1. Pulling up a description view from a server config will cause the description view to appear, then immediately disappear
			- This only happens on device, not in the simulator or previews
		2. Seen on simulator: Select new deck format and the button text doesn't change until you tap it.
		3. Seen once: The cards in the view were not displayed properly. They would have gaps and some cards would appear on top of
			the wrong cards in the view. Perhaps a multithreading issue with the card list?
	- App relies on its built-in decks.json file rather than the decks availble from the server
	- Config tab needs a commit button to cause the device to write the config file for persistent settings

When time permits

	- Run thread sanitizer on all apps and get some good coverage
	- Check out other sanitizers and diagnostic tools to help find bugs
	- Find all places where we Thread.sleep on a boolean and use DispatchSemaphore

	- CardBars should have a way to show Code Definition validation errors/warnings (currently, they are only visible in the logs)
	- Figure out how to get the iPad to see UV/black ink automatically (the camera can do this)
	- Possibly a "binarize" method in EdgeDetection which rolls the min/max but checks sample and returns Bools rather than Edges?
	- Thread it for more cores (trace marks is a good starting point) - or.. maybe not?
	- Support for GPIO
	- While Whisper is in daemon mode, do not scan while nothing is connected (and kill the camera to save battery)

IMPROVEMENTS (when time permits)

	- For development, the video decoder is too slow on rPI. Maybe check re-installing from scratch?
	- It freaks out at 45-degrees, likely due to the use of perpendicular normals due to the integer math
	- Decks do not detect well when rotated on the Y axis (this adds perspective to the marks)
	- Missing cards are only inserted if one is missing (and not a chain of missing cards)
	- Dealing with a rounded top card (somehow)
	- The messages sent over wifi should be JSON rather than binary
